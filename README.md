# gestures

This WordPress plugin adds gestures to WordPress as explained here:

[wpmudev.org: Donâ€™t Make Your Mobile Users Think: Support Gestures On Your WordPress Site](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/easily-add-touch-gestures-to-your-wordpress-site/)

This is a fork of the repo ([pommiegranit/gestures/](https://github.com/pommiegranit/gestures/)) mentioned in above wpmudev post and mainly updated the version of [GianlucaGuarini/Tocca.js](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini/Tocca.js)

I'm not sure yet hown good it works.
